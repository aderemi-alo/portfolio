Portfolio Design System

Product: Personal Portfolio Website
Owner: Remi
Primary Goal: Communicate professional Flutter capability, clarity of thinking, and readiness for production teams

1. Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Clarity over expression
The site should feel calm, intentional, and easy to scan in under 30 seconds.

Minimal color, strong hierarchy
Visual hierarchy must come from spacing, typography, and contrast — not color noise.

Subtle motion only
Animation should reinforce structure and interaction, never draw attention to itself.

Production-grade feel
This should feel like a real product landing page, not a personal experiment.

2. Color System
